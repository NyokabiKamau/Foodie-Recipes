# Description
This is a Single Page Application (SPA) that enables a user to search and view food recipes

## Project Requirements

### Minimum Viable Product
The web application you create must contain the following:
1. A dummy authentication page. This can include either a login or signup form. For extra challenge; include both. The page does not need any real authentication mechanism, dummy data is enough.
2. A navigation menu with at least 3 menu options that is persistent throughout the entire application. (Positioning of the navigation menu is absolutely dependent on your own preference.)
3. Your application must provide some form of search functionality.
It should contain at least three HTML forms.

### User Stories
1. When the user loads the page, they will view random images recipes
2. After 2 seconds, a pop-up authentification page will appear asking the user to Sign Up or Sign In
3. The authentification pop up will disappear after the click and an alert message saying that the authentification was successful appears .
4. After clicking ok the user will have uninterrupted access to the page to view meal recipes with a written or video tutorial. 
5. The user can also click on the lick button if they liked the recipe
6. There is also a search button that the user can type a meal ingredient e.g beef and it will display all the recipes that have beef
7. There is a feedback section for the user to rate the page experience out of 5 stars and leave a comment
